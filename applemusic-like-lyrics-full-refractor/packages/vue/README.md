## Usage Summary

Since Vue components are not convenient for generating API documentation, please refer to the type definition files to determine usage.

(Or refer to the React binding, as both have identical properties and reference methods)

A test program can be found in [./src/test.ts](./src/test.ts).

```vue
<tamplate>
    <LyricPlayer :lyric-lines="[]" :current-time="0" />
</tamplate>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { LyricPlayer } from "@applemusic-like-lyrics/vue";

</script>
```
